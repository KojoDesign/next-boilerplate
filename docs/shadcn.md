# Creating UI components

Most UI components will be created via `[shadcn-ui]`, which has been aliased to `ui` script in this repo.

Simply a command such as

```bash
pnpm ui add button
```

to automatically install a new button component to `src/components/ui`.

**For more info on `shadcn-ui`, [read the official docs](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).**
